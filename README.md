# MinneMUDAC-Challenge-Predict-Soybean-Prices

Together with my team members, I represented Winona State University at the state-wide competition - Midwest Undergraduate Data Analytics Competition (MinneMUDAC). It consisted of forecasting the price of soybeans and giving general advice for farmers on whether they should invest in soybean contracts. Because the data that was given to us was limited, we had to research external sources and scrape our data. Several times, we had to apply various statistical models, clean the data, write and review our code, and visualize our results for the final presentation. Overall, my team scored in 6th place out of 43 undergraduate teams and placed 2nd place for accuracy of our predictions â€“ which was higher than that of most of the graduate division teams.
